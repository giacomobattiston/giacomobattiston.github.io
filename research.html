        Rescue on Stage: Border Enforcement and Public Attention in the
        Mediterranean
        </h4>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
        Migrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe.
        European border enforcement (BE) and humane treatment make for
        conflicting objectives. The former suggests to increase the risk for
        migrants to cross in order to deter migration; the latter requires to
        reduce this risk. The trade-off is dynamic, as present policy influences
        future policy expectations by migrants. Also, if the planner is more
        preoccupied by outcomes in periods of higher monitoring, this trade-off
        interacts with public attention. Incorporating these factors, I model
        rescue policy in the Mediterranean during operation Triton (2014-2017)
        estimating a dynamic model of policy choice and public attention. I show
        that the model can explain both long-term and short-term policy shifts.

        Informing Risky Migration: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial in
        the Republic of Guinea

        We study whether migration decisions towards Europe can be shaped by the
        provision of information related to the risk and cost of the journey and
        to the economic situation in the destination countries. We do so by
        conducting a randomized experiment among potential migrants in Guinea
        combining hard data, video-testimonies by migrants who completed the
        journey, and example stories of migration. We study the effect of three
        treatments: one in which we only deliver information about risks and
        costs, one in which we only give information about migrants' economic
        outcomes, and a treatment pooling the two previous types of information.
        Results forthcoming.

        Third Party Interest, Resource Value, and the Likelihood of Conflict
        </h4>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">

        </p>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
        We build a model of resource war to investigate the impact of a change
        in the resource value on the likelihood of a conflict. A predator
        decides if to wage war against a resource holder and seize its resource.
        A powerful third party can intervene to back the defendant. However,
        it does not act as a social planner but it maximizes its own profits.
        Then, the effect of a change in resource value is a priori unclear.
        On the one hand, increased resource value results in a higher incentive
        to predate, on the other hand it makes for a higher incentive
        to intervene by the third party, increasing deterrence. Under general
        assumptions, we find that the probability of a conflict as a function
        resource value is is hump-shaped. We find empirical grounding for our
        model using data on interstate and civil conflicts from the MID and PRIO
        databases, instrumenting resource value with data on sediments from the
        CRUST database. In work in progress, we are developing a structural
        version of the model to study quantitatively counterfactual scenarios.
