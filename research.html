        Rescue on Stage: Border Enforcement and Public Attention in the
        Mediterranean
        </h4>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
Irregular migrants attempt to cross it in order to reach Europe. European border enforcement has the conflicting
          objectives of preventing irregular migration and granting humane treatment to migrants. The former would
          lead policy to increase the risk for migrants to cross in order to deter migration; the latter would require
          reducing this risk. Indeed, exploiting geo-located data on the universe of rescue operations between 2014 and 2017,
          I show that rescue policy influences departures. Further, I show that policy impacts risk for migrants, too,
          using exogenous variation. The implied trade-off is dynamic, as present policy influences future policy
          expectations by migrants. In addition, if the policy-maker is more concerned with outcomes during periods
          of higher monitoring, this trade-off interacts with public attention. I find empirically that this is the
          case, again using shocks to attention uncorrelated with policy and migration. Then, I propose a dynamic model
          of policy choice and public attention and estimate it. I show that the model can explain both long-term
          and short-term policy shifts.

        Informing Risky Migration: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial in
        the Republic of Guinea
        </h4>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">

        </p>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
        We conduct a large scale randomized experiment among 160 secondary schools in Guinea to study whether risky
          and irregular migration towards Europe can be reduced by the provision of information related to the risk
          and cost of journey and to the economic situation in the destination countries. Combining hard data
          and video-testimonies by migrants who settled in Europe, we study the effect of three treatments: one
          in which we deliver information about risks and costs of the journey, one in which we give information
          about migrants economic outcomes, and a treatment pooling the two previous types of information.
          Preliminary results show that information affects perceptions about risks and economic outcomes, and
          about migration intentions. Preliminary evidence shows varying levels of persistence of change across
          different belief types. Also, long-term effects on migration outcomes are concentrated on the non-wealthy students.

        Third Party Interest, Resource Value, and the Likelihood of Conflict
        </h4>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
        <i> Joint with Matteo Bizzarri and Riccardo Franceschin </i>
        </p>

        <p align=justify style="margin-top: 10px">
        We build a model of resource war to investigate the impact of a change in the resource value on the likelihood
          of a conflict. A predator decides if to wage war against a resource holder and seize its resource. A
          powerful third party can intervene to back the defendant. However, it does not act as a social planner but
          it maximizes its own profits. Then, the effect of a change in resource value is a priori unclear. On the one
          hand, increased resource value results in a higher incentive to predate, on the other hand it makes for a
          higher incentive to intervene by the third party, increasing deterrence. Under general assumptions, we find
          that the probability of a conflict as a function resource value is is hump-shaped. We test our prediction
          using data on interstate and civil war.
